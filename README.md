# MyAnimeList.API
A simple .NET Standard wrapper for MAL's API v2. ![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/MyAnimeList.API?style=plastic)

This library provides a client that manages Athentication, Requests and Responses from the API, so that developers can interact with it easily. Authorization ***is not managed*** since each user should accept or decline on their own accord. However: 

  - The authorization URL is generated by the URL.
  - The client has a method to recieve the authorization code and finish the authentication process.
  - Since the code is provided in the redirection URL, it is recomended to have some sort of API/WebService to automatically read the code and call the aforementioned method.

## Current Features!

  - Authenticate aganist the API.
  - Search Animes.


## Future Features!
Basically everything avaliable in the API, but the next ones to become avaliable will be:
  - Check Anime rankings.
  - Check seasonal Anime.
  - Check individual Anime(Detailed).
  - Exception handling.

## Usage Example
I've tried my best to make it easy to use, here's an example where we manually provide the code to a console app:
```cs
            var temp = new UserParams
            {
                ClientId = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
                OAuth2State = "STRING_OF_YOUR CHOICE",
                RedirectURI = "THE_URI"
            };
            MALApiClient client = new MALApiClient(temp);
            string code = client.GetAuthUrl(); //The URL to authorize the API usage for our account
            Console.WriteLine(code); // Print to console, copy the url and allow from a browser
            client.DoAuth(Console.ReadLine()); // From the url copy the code and paste it.

            Console.Write("Search: "); 
            string s = Console.ReadLine();//Input string to search
            GetAnimeListRequest xd = new GetAnimeListRequest // Create a request object, limit is the maximum amount of entries to obtain
            {
                Search = s,
                Limit = 10
            };
            var ls = client.GetAnimeList(xd).Result;
            foreach (var item in ls.data)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("\t" + item.node.title); // Print Anime title
            }
            
```
More examples and better documentation will be added as more features are added.
